            Howdy, OYFA. My name is Taylor Mendoza, and I'm proud to serve as President for the 2021-2022 term. 
            I'm a fourth year majoring in Economics and Commerce and I'm from the best state in the DMV. 
            You can usually find me at the MSC, on the tennis courts, or occasionally in class. My hobbies 
            include spending time with my OYFAmily, collecting records, boarding of the snow and skate variety, 
            and appreciating nonstandard corporate architecture. I'm so excited to play a part in this amazing 
            organization in my last year at UVA, so looking forward to a great year!

            Hey guys!!!! I'm Arabella Chiang and I'm your Treasurer this year, so be on the 
            look out for those Venmo requests ;) I'm currently a 3rd year majoring in 
            Statistics and minoring in East Asian Studies. I was born in Montgomery, 
            Maryland, but was raised in Ashburn, VA, so I'm another NOVA kid here at UVA. 
            If anyone lives in NOVA and wants to hang out over breaks hit me up :))
            <br>
            Just a little about me, I love being on the go, so come out and adventure 
            with me. There's many mountains to hike and trails to walk in Cville! I also 
            love to just be around people and is always down to hang. I am a talker and 
            can talk your ear off, so if you're down to hang I'm here! I am also a huge 
            foodie, so come get food with me too. Maybe I'll cook, you never know. 
            <br>
            Anyways, I somehow found my way into OYFA my first year and was able to find 
            people who I call my best friends and practically my family. I remember being 
            hesitant in joining, until Sofia dragged me out to make Tiktoks with her and 
            then the rest was history!

            Hi hi friends - My name is Sam Dioneda, and I'm a second year nursing student 
            serving as your Recording Secretary this school year. Outside of OYFA and being 
            a nursing student, I am apart of MAN and was an OL this summer, so hi if you 
            were an orientee of mine! When I'm not doing anything related to school or 
            OYFA, I love to bake, cook, eat sugar lol, run, read manga, and binge anime.
            <br>
            Besides the above, I also love to see people smile. Seeing people happy with 
            who they are and what they do is as addicting as sugar to me, and I always 
            strive to create that environment it whatever situation I am in.
            <br>
            As for OYFA, it may sound cliché, but OYFA has given me a home in the grand 
            place that is UVA, and I am eternally grateful for that. Coming in as a first 
            year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways 
            I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like 
            dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure 
            or the rest of my life. 
            <br>
            So enough of me already, we can talk about that another time. If you're reading 
            this and you're on the website... see you at OYFA events and I hope to get to 
            know you and see you smile :))

            UVA (': OYFA has given me some of the greatest experiences of my life throughout 
            the past 3 years, and I can't wait to make even more memories with you all this 
            year. outside of my academics, I enjoy being unapologetically myself, advocating 
            for mental health and wellness (which I have struggled with for almost a decade 
            so if you ever need someone to talk to I am always here!), and serving people 
            in my community. my other hobbies include cooking yummy vegan recipes, going on 
            hikes around the Blue Ridge area, tanning at the pool and beach, playing tennis, 
            and singing even though I have awful performance anxiety. hmu if you wanna be

          <p>Hey guys!!!! I'm Arabella Chiang and I'm one of your PR chairs this year! I'm currently a 2nd year hoping to get into the Comm school, but we'll see how that goes. I'm an adventurer and love to explore the outdoors. If anyone is down to go hiking or exploring around Cville, be sure to reach out to me. Can't wait to see everyone's beautiful faces on ZOOM :)   </p>
          <p>There are so many OYFA memories I've created with my friends in the short year we had, but one of my favorites was for sure the dance practices for Culturefest and Barrio, even though I'm a terrible dancer. Everyone is always there to hype you up and there's never any judgement. It was always a fun time, and through these dance practices I was able to find people who I call my best friends today :) </p>

          <p>My favorite OYFA memory would have to be the entirety of the Culturefest experience. It’s a new vibe every year! I love to watch the babies have fun learning the dances, rocking their performances on stage, and letting out all their crazy energy that night. It’s an OYFA tradition I hope everyone will get the chance to live out.</p>

Super excited to be with you all again for another year <3</p>
          <p>What I love most about OYFA is the fact that it gave me some of my closest friends. We're at a big school, and OYFA is pretty big as well, so it can get overwhelming sometimes, but finding even just a few people in an organization that (1) has a lot of people like me, and (2) already feels so close-knit like family changed my college experience in the best way possible.</p>

          <p>Everyone has their own experience within OYFA, but ultimately, they all stem from the same root: the family, support, and connections you find from it. That's the nature of OYFA; if you are a Oyfan, you are part of an extensive family, dating from alumni who even post-graduation will lend whatever help they can, to current members who share in your day-to-day life on grounds. This family that you find yourself in is incredibly supportive, something that some people never really get to experience in their lives. Whether you need someone to hype you up at an event, give you advice on classes/careers, walk you through a breakdown, or just chill with on a Friday night, there is someone--quite a few someones--who would do all that for you in a heartbeat. Frankly, you can't find better people :)</p>

          <p>Hello! My name is Josh and I am one of the Webmasters this year. I'm studying computer science in the school of Arts and Sciences. I love hiking, tennis, soccer, food, baking, and more! Message me if you would like someone to talk to /hike with/anything else!</p>
          <p>One of my favorite OYFA memories is when I painted with my Big and his friends. We made Spongebob paintings, and I painted Patrick working out his exxtra thick glutes :O. It was so nice to have people to goof with-- I was worried I wouldn't find a group like that going into college.</p>

          <p>Hi! My name is Anh Nguyen and I am one of your webmaster chairs! I'm a 2nd year majoring in CS in the E-School. I love anime so lmk if you wanna binge anything or need recommendations :)</p>
          <p>One of my favorite memories in OYFA was when I went to events during fall fam week. I remember I showed up to one of the culturefest dance practices, and my fam head hyped me up and made me feel so confident even though I didn't meet her officially. Her, my bigs, and many more have made me feel so welcomed and loved at UVA. </p>

          <p>My favorite OYFA memories are probably spending sleepless nights at Clark or 1815 and going in spontaneous 2am cookout runs (o^^o)</p>

            <p>hi there! Thanks for visiting the bio page of the OYFA website. I'm Dre Dilao and I'm one of OYFA's Student Advisors (SA).

            <p>OYFA takes me for who I am, and gave me my forever friends- the people who know all of my secrets and love me anyway, and the ones I'll grow old with and invite to my deathbed.</p>
