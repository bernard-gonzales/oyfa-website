          <p>Helloyfa! My name is Joshua Dano, and I am the OYFA President for this year! I'm a 3rd year majoring in Computer Science and Global Public Health (what am I doing after I graduate? Hoo knows honestly) My favorite pastimes are practicing calligraphy during class instead of actually taking notes, changing my major and life plan, and binge watching new Netflix shows!</p>
          <p>My favorite OYFA memory is the Culturefest Night Before Run Throughs during my first year. That's the moment I truly realized that OYFA was my home away from home and from then on I knew I wanted to give back to this organization as much as I can.</p>

          <p>Hello friends, my name is Michelle Hilado and I am excited to serve as OYFA's Vice President for the 2020-2021 school year! I am a 4th year student in the College majoring in Biology with a minor in American Sign Language. Some things that I like are summer, bad horror movies, cute animal tiktoks, and bagels!</p>
          <p>What I like about OYFA is that it connects me with other people who have a similar culture and/or upbringing to me! My favorite OYFA memories involve /attempting/ to dance at any Barrio or Culturefest practices (emphasis on attempting).</p>

          <p>Howdy, OYFA. My name is Taylor Mendoza and I’ll be serving as this year's Treasurer on Board. I’m a third year in the McIntire School of Commerce, likely concentrating in Finance and IT in addition to an Economics Major. In my free time, I like to play tennis, watch movies, shoegaze, and play guitar. I’m quite excited to be serving on OYFA’s B&C again, and can’t wait to meet all of you throughout the year.</p>
          <p>My favorite OYFA memory is shredding the mountains of Massanutten like it was nothin’ alongside many of my friends in OYFA.</p>

Once we're back in person, you'll find me with my pup (Luna) on Grounds! I love music (I play bass clarinet and ukelele-ish) so let's exchange music recommendations!</p>
            <p>I'll never forget first year during Assassins when I started talking to Monique in our COLA class to gain her trust, only to ask to see and hold her lime immunity because I couldn't tell if it was real. Owen swooped in from behind with his sock and made the kill. Love you Monique! <3</p>

Besides that, I take photos, water my plants, and make a mean boba, so if any of those things interest you, hmu!</p>
            <p>Def Lakas. After the volleyball tournament in 2019, I was introduced to so many of the best facets that oyfa has to offer that thereafter, I felt like I had a home on grounds with this org. This event was the first time I ever took photos, had a conversation with some really amazing people in my family, and played with volleyball with a group (tho I’m still negative good at it). From this event, I was opened to so many opportunities that oyfa had to offer, beyond the dance/party aspect of it (which tbh ain’t my speed), and realized that there’s something for everyone here in oyfa.</p>

          <p>Heyo! My name is Jazlyn Nguyen and I am 1/2 of your culture chairs! I'm a 3rd year (ew) majoring in Cognitive Science. I like reading tarot cards, playing DnD, and making space dubstep. Hit me up if ya wanna know your future! (Hint: it's in OYFA) </p>
          <p>There I was, in the middle of the parking lot, left to my own devices (a nerf gun). It was dark, but not stormy, and I was petrified as I had to traverse the uneven gravel to arrive at the final destination: family reveal party. As I took a step into the unknown, I heard someone shout WATCH OUT," and I saw it. A nerf bullet. Coming in slow motion towards me. I bent backwards in hopes of surviving another day, and the bullet passed through the dense air. I looked around frantically, and saw a dark figure move quickly. This was my opportunity. This was my chance to prove myself worthy of OYFA. And so I lifted my nerf gun, and took a shot in the dark. I heard a grunt. I hit him. And that figure is now my big. All this to say, I love how people in OYFA go out of their way to make sure you're having a good time. The people I have met in this org will undoubtedly be my lifelong friends, and we will never stop having fun, dramatic, whacky times! #LiveLaughLOYFA"</p>

Music also plays a pretty big role in my life s0o if you wanna drive down 64 while listening to music and question our existence or go to a concert (once it's safe again) pls don't be shy and reach out:)) I also really got into kdramas and BTS during quarantine so if you wanna fangirl about Park Seo-joon, I'm always down <3</p>
          <p>There's too many to choose from ugh but one of my favorite OYFA memories would have to be our Secret Santa event. It was just so wholesome and seeing every smile with their gifts and people being excited to reveal who they were, coupled with that Christmas spirit, made my heart so happy. That whole time just feels like a nice warm hug. </p>

Since I love fun facts, and I will give you 3! 1. I love Hamilton 2. I once overdosed on gummy vitamins and had to get my stomach pumped, and 3. I can't wait to meet/reconnect with you all <3 HMU if you ever want to vibe, skate, edit videos, eat cheese ramen, or literally anything (that respects social distancing ;))! Stay fly and stay safe. </p>
          <p>Have you ever seen Thor Ragnarok (ofc you have) when Odin says, "Asgard is not a place, it's a people". I truly believe the same applies to OYFA. My favorite aspect of this org are the amazing members- that always hype you up, are always supportive of you, and ready to lend a hand whenever you need. And because the people are so awesome, every event feels special and memorable. With that being said, some notable events would include Oyfassassins, Fam Week, and Culturefest! <3 </p>

          <p>Hey guys!!!! I'm Arabella Chiang and I'm one of your PR chairs this year! I'm currently a 2nd year hoping to get into the Comm school, but we'll see how that goes. I'm an adventurer and love to explore the outdoors. If anyone is down to go hiking or exploring around Cville, be sure to reach out to me. Can't wait to see everyone's beautiful faces on ZOOM :)   </p>
          <p>There are so many OYFA memories I've created with my friends in the short year we had, but one of my favorites was for sure the dance practices for Culturefest and Barrio, even though I'm a terrible dancer. Everyone is always there to hype you up and there's never any judgement. It was always a fun time, and through these dance practices I was able to find people who I call my best friends today :) </p>

To see everyone excited and proud of what they've been able to accomplish over the past few months just made me really happy.

          <p>My favorite OYFA memory would have to be the entirety of the Culturefest experience. It’s a new vibe every year! I love to watch the babies have fun learning the dances, rocking their performances on stage, and letting out all their crazy energy that night. It’s an OYFA tradition I hope everyone will get the chance to live out.</p>

          <p>When I first laid eyes on Josh Dano... jk but that was also a great experience. What I really enjoy most about OYFA are all the little interactions I have with everyone in the organization. There is just a sense of community and inclusiveness that holds strong within the core of OYFA and that's why I love it so!</p>

          <p>Hello OYFAm~ I'm Jana, I use she/her pronouns, and I'm a 3rd-year nursing student serving as 1 of 2 Advocacy Chairs this school year. Outside of OYFA and being a nurse, I was also an OL these past 2 summers and am part of WAALI. I also love to draw, play guitar, experiment with makeup, watch anime, and read. Super excited to be with you all again for another year <3</p>
          <p>What I love most about OYFA is the fact that it gave me some of my closest friends. We're at a big school, and OYFA is pretty big as well, so it can get overwhelming sometimes, but finding even just a few people in an organization that (1) has a lot of people like me, and (2) already feels so close-knit like family changed my college experience in the best way possible.</p>

          <p>Everyone has their own experience within OYFA, but ultimately, they all stem from the same root: the family, support, and connections you find from it. That's the nature of OYFA; if you are a Oyfan, you are part of an extensive family, dating from alumni who even post-graduation will lend whatever help they can, to current members who share in your day-to-day life on grounds. This family that you find yourself in is incredibly supportive, something that some people never really get to experience in their lives. Whether you need someone to hype you up at an event, give you advice on classes/careers, walk you through a breakdown, or just chill with on a Friday night, there is someone--quite a few someones--who would do all that for you in a heartbeat. Frankly, you can't find better people :)</p>
